# Image-Healer-Img-Editing-Tools-

SYNOPSIS 

  The Image HealerTool is a software application that allows users to modify and edit images with five main functionalities: image cropping, height and width changing, image compression, and image to PDF conversion, image filters changer.

Modules:

Image Cropper: 

  This functionality enables users to crop images to a specific size, allowing them to focus on a particular area of the image or to adjust the overall composition of the image. Cropping an image is the removal of unwanted areas from a photograph or illustrated image. You might want to crop an image for several different reasons,including:
  
 1., Eliminating visual distractions and highlighting your subject
 2., Improving a photoâ€™s framing and accentuating its subject
 3., Changing the aspect ratio to prepare for sharing through different social media platforms

Height and Width Changer:

  In an image healer tool, the image resizer and compressor functionalities are typically used to modify and optimize images for various purposes.Image resizer functionality in an image healer  tool allows users to change the size of an image by increasing or decreasing its dimensions while maintaining its aspect ratio. Users can choose to resize an image manually or use presets that provide standard sizes for different applications, such as social media or website banners. The image resizer function allows users to optimize images for specific purposes, such as making them fit specific image placeholders or reducing their overall size to save disk space.
  The compressor functionality in an image healer  tool allows users to reduce the file size of an image without compromising its quality. Compression is especially useful when sharing images online, as it reduces the time it takes to upload or download the image. Image compression can be lossy or lossless, and users can choose between the two options depending on their requirements. Lossy compression results in a smaller file size but can reduce image quality, while lossless compression retains the quality of the image but results in a slightly larger file size.
  In addition to image resizer and compressor functionality, many image healer  tools also provide options to optimize image quality and reduce file size. For example, users can adjust image brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness to make the image more visually appealing and optimize its overall quality.

Image Filters :
  Image filters are algorithms that manipulate or enhance images to produce a desired effect or result. They can perform tasks such as removing noise, sharpening, blurring, changing brightness or contrast, adding special effects, and more. Image filters are widely used in photo editing software, computer vision, and other digital image processing applications.

Image to PDF Converter:
  An image to PDF converter is a functionality in image editing tools that allows users to convert image files into PDF format. This functionality is particularly useful when users need to combine multiple image files into a single PDF document or when they need to create a PDF file that contains an image.
In an image editing tool, the image to PDF converter functionality typically works by allowing users to select one or more image files and then converting them into a single PDF document. Users can choose to either merge all the images into a single page or create a multi-page PDF document that includes all the images.
